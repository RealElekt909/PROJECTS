==PLEASE READ!!==

The sprites, backgrounds, music/sound effects, and other assets do NOT belong to me. I just make visual novels for free, so that everyone can enjoy them! ;)

Read the 'credits.txt' file for credits.

Also, if you see any bugs/issues in any of the games, please let me know! I'll be very grateful.

And lastly, so that I can quit yapping... I hope you'll enjoy playing through these VNs! :D
