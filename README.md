**==PLEASE READ!!==**

<br>The sprites, backgrounds, music/sound effects, and other assets do ***NOT*** belong to me, nor do I own them in any way. I just make visual novels for free, so that everyone can enjoy them! ;)

<br>Read the '[credits.txt](https://github.com/RealElekt909/PROJECTS/blob/main/credits.txt)' file for credits.

<br>Also, if you see any bugs/issues in any of the games, please let me know! I'll be *very* grateful.

<br>And lastly, so that I can quit yapping... I hope you'll enjoy playing through these VNs! :D
